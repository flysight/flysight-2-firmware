# FlySight Firmware Deployment Process

## Overview

This document describes the process for preparing and deploying encrypted firmware updates for FlySight devices. The primary tool for this process is the `deploy_firmware.py` Python script, which encrypts firmware binaries (`.bin`) and packages them into a secure firmware update format (`.sfb`).

This documentation is intended for developers involved in building and releasing FlySight firmware. It covers the necessary tools, file organization, script configuration, and the step-by-step procedure for generating deployment-ready firmware files.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy FlySight firmware, ensure you have the following:

*   **Python Environment:** Python 3.6 or newer.
*   **Required Python Libraries:**
    *   `coincurve`
    *   `ecdh_aesgcm`
    You can install these libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install coincurve ecdh_aesgcm
    ```
*   **Deployment Script:** The `deploy_firmware.py` script.
*   **Firmware Binaries:** Compiled firmware files (e.g., `UserApp.bin`) ready for deployment.
*   **Public Key Files:** Batch-specific public key files (e.g., `pub_key_b2.bin`) corresponding to the target FlySight units.

## Key Components

### Directory Structure

A specific directory structure is expected by the `deploy_firmware.py` script:

*   `Firmware_As_Built/`: This directory is used to store the compiled firmware binaries that you intend to deploy. You will typically copy your `UserApp.bin` (or other named firmware versions) into this folder.
*   `Public_Keys/`: This directory should contain the public key files (`.bin`) for the different production batches of FlySight devices.
*   `Firmware_To_Deploy/`: This is the output directory where the script will place the generated encrypted firmware update files (`.sfb`). The script will create this directory if it does not already exist.

### Input Files

#### Firmware Binaries

*   The primary firmware file is typically named `UserApp.bin`, generated by the firmware build process.
*   These files should be placed in the `Firmware_As_Built/` directory.
*   You can place multiple firmware files in this directory if you intend to deploy different versions or types of firmware. Each will be configured in the deployment script.

#### Public Key Files

*   Public keys are stored as binary files (e.g., `pub_key_b2.bin`, `pub_key_b3.bin`) in the `Public_Keys/` directory.
*   Each public key corresponds to a specific manufacturing batch of FlySight devices (e.g., B2, B3). Firmware encrypted with a particular public key can only be installed on devices from the corresponding batch.

### Identifying the Correct Public Key for a Device

FlySight devices are manufactured in batches, and each batch is provisioned with a specific public key. To determine which public key was used for a particular FlySight unit:

1.  Turn on the FlySight device.
2.  Connect it to a computer via USB.
3.  Open the `flysight.txt` file located in the root directory of the FlySight's storage.
4.  Look for the `Pubkey_X` value. This hexadecimal string is a hash of the public key used by the device.
5.  Use the table below to map this `Pubkey_X` value to the corresponding public key file and batch name.

**Public Key Index:**

| `Pubkey_X` (from `flysight.txt`)                             | Public Key File      | Batch Name |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :--------- |
| `486bee2d3dd60fd0de481a072d12ae5492c52c0cb2bbdde697b16aad1ca903f3` | `pub_key_b2.bin`     | B2         |
| `211d721dbd9114a6bbe9ba1256ccbbfbf2c4015b139126ab56c331935e29c016` | `pub_key_b3.bin`     | B3         |
| `dac40d2597e371390a84f3196d4256b5c96a89373afb3584dcbc226b74bcbc0c` | `pub_key_b4.bin`     | B4         |
| `3157e02846ddfd2a78347e099ba1d86c92920b101137f28091ed0dec3b4589c2`  | `pub_key_b5.bin`     | B5         |
| `8ee7870905b3e792df0ed796b996c9ff743d196c2e8abbf1a39f39733cceac80` | `pub_key_b6.bin`     | B6         |

## The `deploy_firmware.py` Script

The `deploy_firmware.py` script automates the process of encrypting firmware files for secure updates.

### Core Functionality

The script performs the following actions for each specified firmware file and public key combination:
1.  Reads the target device batch's public key.
2.  Generates a new, random ephemeral key pair for this encryption session.
3.  Reads the firmware binary data.
4.  Encrypts the firmware data using an ECDH-derived shared secret and AES-GCM.
5.  Constructs a header (`.sfb` header) containing metadata, cryptographic information (like the ephemeral public key, nonce, and firmware tag), and a MAC for header integrity.
6.  Combines the header and the encrypted firmware into a single `.sfb` file.

### Configuration

At the bottom of the `deploy_firmware.py` script, within the `main()` function, two Python lists control the deployment process:

*   **`fw_files`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple specifies a firmware binary to be deployed.
    *   Format: `('path/to/firmware.bin', 'FirmwareBaseName')`
    *   Example: `('Firmware_As_Built/UserApp_v1.2.3.bin', 'UserApp_v1.2.3')`
*   **`pk_files`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple specifies a public key to be used for encryption.
    *   Format: `('path/to/public_key.bin', 'BatchName')`
    *   Example: `('Public_Keys/pub_key_b2.bin', 'B2')`

The script will iterate through each firmware file in `fw_files` and encrypt it with each public key in `pk_files`.

### Running the Script

To execute the deployment process, run the script from your terminal in the directory containing the script and the associated folders (`Firmware_As_Built`, `Public_Keys`):

```bash
python deploy_firmware.py```

The script will print progress information for each encryption operation to the console.

### Output Files

*   The encrypted firmware update files are saved in the `Firmware_To_Deploy/` directory.
*   The output files are named using a combination of the batch name and the firmware base name, with an `.sfb` extension.
    *   Format: `{BatchName}_{FirmwareBaseName}.sfb`
    *   Example: `B2_UserApp_v1.2.3.sfb`

## Encryption Scheme Overview

The firmware deployment process employs a robust cryptographic scheme to ensure the authenticity and integrity of firmware updates, and to restrict updates to authorized device batches.

*   **Key Agreement:** Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is used to establish a shared secret between the deployment script and the target device batch. The script generates an ephemeral (temporary) ECDH key pair and combines its ephemeral private key with the batch's public key (read from files like `pub_key_b2.bin`) to derive the shared secret. The ephemeral public key is included in the `.sfb` header for the device to use in deriving the same shared secret.
*   **Authenticated Encryption:** AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode) is used to encrypt the firmware. AES-GCM provides both confidentiality (encryption) and authenticity/integrity (via a MAC tag). The shared secret from ECDH is used as the AES key.
*   **Secure Firmware Update (`.sfb`) File:** The generated `.sfb` file has a specific structure:
    *   **Header:**
        *   Magic Bytes: `SFU1` identifying the file type.
        *   Version Information.
        *   Size of the original (unencrypted) firmware.
        *   The AES-GCM authentication tag for the encrypted firmware payload.
        *   The 12-byte nonce used for AES-GCM encryption of the firmware.
        *   The 64-byte ephemeral public key generated by the `deploy_firmware.py` script.
        *   A 16-byte GMAC (Galois Message Authentication Code) tag covering the entire header preceding it. This tag ensures the integrity of the header itself and is generated using the same ECDH shared secret and nonce but with the header as "additional authenticated data" (AAD).
        *   Reserved fields for future use or padding.
    *   **Encrypted Firmware:** The actual firmware data, encrypted with AES-GCM.

This scheme ensures that only a device possessing the correct private key (corresponding to the public key used during deployment) can decrypt and verify the firmware update.

## Deployment Workflow (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps to generate encrypted firmware update files:

1.  **Ensure Prerequisites:** Verify that Python 3 and the `coincurve` and `ecdh_aesgcm` libraries are installed.
2.  **Obtain Firmware:** Compile your FlySight firmware. This typically results in a `UserApp.bin` file.
3.  **Place Firmware:** Copy the `UserApp.bin` (or your specifically named firmware binary) into the `Firmware_As_Built/` directory. For example, you might rename it to `UserApp_vX.Y.Z.bin`.
4.  **Verify Public Keys:** Ensure that the public key files for your target batches (e.g., `pub_key_b2.bin`, `pub_key_b3.bin`) are present in the `Public_Keys/` directory.
5.  **Configure Script:**
    *   Open `deploy_firmware.py` in a text editor.
    *   Locate the `fw_files` list near the end of the script. Modify it to point to the firmware binary you placed in `Firmware_As_Built/` and assign it a descriptive base name.
        ```python
        fw_files = [
            ('Firmware_As_Built/UserApp_vX.Y.Z.bin', 'UserApp_vX.Y.Z'),
            # Add other firmware files if needed
        ]
        ```
    *   Locate the `pk_files` list. Modify it to include the public keys and batch names for all target batches.
        ```python
        pk_files = [
            ('Public_Keys/pub_key_b2.bin', 'B2'),
            ('Public_Keys/pub_key_b3.bin', 'B3'),
            # Add other public keys if needed
        ]
        ```
    *   Save the changes to `deploy_firmware.py`.
6.  **Run Deployment Script:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `deploy_firmware.py`, and run:
    ```bash
    python deploy_firmware.py
    ```
7.  **Collect Output Files:** After the script completes, find the generated `.sfb` files in the `Firmware_To_Deploy/` directory. For the example configuration above, you would find files like `B2_UserApp_vX.Y.Z.sfb` and `B3_UserApp_vX.Y.Z.sfb`.
8.  **Distribute:** These `.sfb` files are now ready for distribution and use in the FlySight firmware update process for the corresponding device batches.
